The `wikispace` is deeply indebted to the TiddlyWiki ecosystem and its community. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the following individuals and groups:

* ''Jeremy Ruston'', the creator of TiddlyWiki, for developing such a powerful, elegantly designed, and highly flexible note-taking system. TiddlyWiki laid the foundation for everything this project builds upon.
* ''Soren Bjornstad'', the author of [[GrokTiddlyWiki|https://groktiddlywiki.com]], whose tutorial is by far the best resource I’ve encountered for learning TiddlyWiki. It taught me the fundamentals and opened the door to more advanced use. His personal site [[Mosaic Muse|https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com]], also built on TiddlyWiki, offered me a great deal of inspiration and insight.
* [[林一二|https://onetwo.ren/wiki/]], founder of the Chinese TiddlyWiki community. It was through his series of Chinese-language materials and promotion that I was first introduced to TiddlyWiki.
* The TiddlyWiki community at large, for their kindness, generosity, and support. Whenever I faced difficulties while using TiddlyWiki, the community was always there with helpful guidance and encouragement.
