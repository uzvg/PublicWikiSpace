|`Seed` |The index note is just a placeholder or has minimal content. |
|`Sketched` |Initial structure or ideas are outlined, but links are sparse or missing. |
|`Linked` |Core related notes are linked, but structure is still rough or incomplete. |
|`Structured` |The note has clear sections, relevant links, and starts forming a coherent map. |
|`Refined` |Well-structured with thoughtful summaries, organized categories, and rich links. |
|`Mature` |Fully integrated into the Zettelkasten — acts as a reliable hub for its topic. |
